# IS 505 Python for Business Analytics
*Fall 2017*
## Course Description
>In this course, we introduce Python as a language and tool for collecting, preprocessing, and visualizing data for business analytics. Since Python is one of the most popular programming languages (along with R) in data mining and business analytics, its fundamental programming logic and knowledge is essential for students to apply in data mining and to succeed in the job market. Specifically, this course focuses on the data-engineering phase, which includes collecting, preprocessing, and visualizing data, with respect to applications in business modeling, optimization, and statistical analysis. In addition, a number of mini projects will be used as vehicles to cover the main applications of data analytics, including recommender systems, text analytics, and web analytics.

## Learning Objectives

### Theory
* To introduce fundamentals of logical reasoning as used in contemporary programming languages
* To survey basic and advanced data structures needed to organize, store, and integrate data
* To master syntax, control structures, data types, etc. in the Python programming language
* To introduce Python as a tool for data science

### Practice
* To write Python scripts of intermediate length and complexity
* To design and use custom data structures using built-in and third-party data types
* To integrate and use popular Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, etc.
* To master a professional-level data science software toolkit

## Instructor
>Christopher L. Huntley  
Dolan School of Business, Room 1122  
Email: chuntley@fairfield.edu  

## Office Hours
  * Tuesdays 11am-noon & 5:00-6:15pm
  * Fridays 2:00-3:30pm  
  Other times are by appointment only. However, email works well, especially when the instructor is otherwise unavailable.

## Resources
* **Textbook:** Downey, Allen. Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (Second Edition). O'Reilly Media Inc., 2015. We will be using the [free interactive edition](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) from Runestone Academy.
* **Online Tutorials:** [Data Campsâ€™s Online Python Courses](https://www.datacamp.com)
* **Software:** Anaconda (Python, Spyder, Jupyter, etc.) and GitHub Desktop (source code management and collaboration)
* **Hardware:** Each student is expected to bring to class a recent-vintage laptop to class. The student must have admin rights to install software, manage ports, and set file permissions. The laptop should have at least 5GB of free space.
* **Web:** All assignments are available in GitHub Classroom.

## Student Expectations
This is a graduate class intended for serious professionals:
* Expect to spend at least 12 hours per week attending class and completing your assignments.
* Do your own work. There is no professional benefit to pretending that somebody else's work is your own. We will follow the university's academic honesty policy to the letter.
* Be a good teammate and class citizen. Free-riding and other unprofessional behavior will result in immediate consequences, which may include failing the course.

*If you cannot abide by these policies then please take another course.*

## Assignments and Course Grade
### Quizzes (50% of Course Grade)
There will be five quizzes, with the lowest grade dropped from your quiz average. They will be given on the days shown in the attached schedule of classes. Quizzes are closed book and closed notes. They are designed to last about 25 minutes, though students will be permitted to work on them up to 40 minutes. The remainder of the class time will be devoted to new material. Please notify the instructor if you require extra time or support services.  
### Final Project (40% of Course Grade)
The final project is meant to a demonstration that the course objectives have been met. Teams will work in teams of 2-3 to complete a project of intermediate complexity and scope. Project details and requirements will be distributed in the fifth week of class.
### Professionalism (10% of Course Grade)
Given the large class enrollment and the technical nature of the subject, it is critical that everyone take a professional approach to learning the material. Students are expected to come to class prepared and then participate in all activities to the best of their abilities. Cheating, free-riding, and other unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.   

## Schedule
* Dates and assignments are subject to change, usually with one week's notice.
* **Classwork** is to be completed before leaving class.
* **Homework** is to be completed before the next class.
* Saturday classes are shown **in bold**.
