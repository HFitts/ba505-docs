# IS505 Final Projects
__ Fall 2017__

## Overview
Students work in teams of 3 students to define and complete a moderately-sized analytical project in Python. Detailed instructions are provided regarding selecting and framing a suitable analysis. Grading criteria will reflect demonstrated achievement of the objectives and compliance with the requirements.

## Objectives
* Apply Python skills to a student-selected analytical project of moderate (but nontrivial) scope and complexity.
* Demonstrate mastery of Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplolib.  
* Work in teams, with professional-quality tools and standards.

## Project Requirements
* **All work must be your own.** It is your responsibility to demonstrate the unique contributions made by your work.
* **Academic honesty policies and scholarship norms apply.** All relevant previous work and data sources must be properly cited.
* **The analysis must be fully reproducible, even and especially with new data.** This is to be professional work, subject to prevalent standards. Suggestion: use unit tests to verify that the data is loading correctly and that the statistical measures are doing what you expect.
* **Descriptive analytics (as in QA400) are sufficient.** However, there is no need to constrain your work. If you can apply forecasting or decision modeling, then feel free to do so.
* **The analysis should stand on its own.** All work will be posted to GitHub Classroom. You will be asked to present your work on the final day of class, but the analysis itself should be readily accessible and understandable from your GitHub repositories without installing any additional software.
* **Project size and scope should be sufficient to demonstrate mastery of Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.** At a minimum the datasets used should have at least 10K records with a dozen or more fields. Further, there should be some opportunity for you to filter/reduce/analyze the data using Pandas and NumPy. If the work could just as easily be performed by an undergraduate in Excel, then keep looking for another project.
* **Only datasets from public sources are allowed.** It should be possible for anyone to reproduce your work, including collecting the data from original sources.

## Instructions
1. Watch and study the following tutorial, which sets the bar for what constitutes A-level work in this course.
[Reproducible Data Analysis in Jupyter]
(https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/).
The tutorial is in 10 parts, with some of the more advanced work in the second half. At a minimum, your project should use the practices in videos 1-5. To get the best grade, however, try to use one or more of the practices shown in videos 6-10.
